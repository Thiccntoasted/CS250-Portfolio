Developing user needs and incorporating them into a software system requires an understanding of the end user's needs, interests, and pain points. This involves engaging with users, seeking their feedback, and developing programmable features from the needs elicited. A good way of doing this is through writing 'user stories.' User stories are simply brief descriptive statements that capture what a user would like to achieve and why. They help bridge the gap between what users need and how developers can implement those needs into the software. In a nutshell, user stories focus on user goals: they assure all development is about bringing value to the end user.

In creating programs, I break them down into chunks of work, prioritize based on what the users are asking for, and go through several iterations to better the solution. I will, therefore, incorporate Agile processes including Scrum and Kanban which have flexibility, mechanisms of feedback, and incremental development. These processes build adaptability for refining the program based on new insights or changes in user needs.

To be good in the team of software development, one should be capable of effective cooperation with others, articulate well, and be trusted upon. It means being part of all discussions within the team, sharing what you know, and doing your part in helping your co-workers reach that common goal. Another thing is being open to advice from others and to giving it, thereby promoting an increased level of work in general. A good team member in an Agile environment practises adaptability and commitment to constant improvement of the individual and of the team.
